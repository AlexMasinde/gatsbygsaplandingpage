# Landing Page 

I build this website to test my skills on layout development and animation using GreenSock's animation library. The project is inspired by this design in figma. [Landing Page Design](https://www.figma.com/file/PzRAVOaXfOL4Y91WB5fB5Q/Hairstylist-Landing-Page-Concept-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1). Currently, the page is designed for desktop use only and the working prototype can be found here [Debonair Landing Page](https://debonairelandingpage.gatsbyjs.io/)
